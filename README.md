Code Challenge 1
### Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray that takes in a list and returns the list in reverse order.

### Challenge
```
Input	                                    Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	                      [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
[89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12]	[-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]
```

### Approach & Efficiency
Used a for loop with range to append elements from the list argument into an empty list in reverse order and return new list.
